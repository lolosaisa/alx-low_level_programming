SINGLY-LINKED-LISSTS
This will contain the several tasks that were used to test my knowledge in singly linked list
what are singly linked list?
It is a type of data structure that helps store data in a particular order.
They are made up of nodes
Each node has teo sides: 1 where it stores the data
                         2 where it stores the address of the next node
The last node on the list always has a NULL on the address part.
You should always have a head
    head is a pointer to the first member on the list
to traverse the list you create a temporary pointer.
